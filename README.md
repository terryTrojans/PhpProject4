# OnlineAppointmentBookingSystem

An Online Appointment Booking System for AltHealth with User as well as the Admin Side.

#Purpose

The purpose of this business is to provide alternative health care options to the people in the community. The owner is also the Health Care Practioner. It is an existing business and there are already a number of patients. The current system is developed in MS Excel and uses a hand filining system. The system works quite well, however the owner would like to expose the business and have an online presence as well. 
The staff of this business consists of two people:
1.  The Health Care Practisioner (HCP)
2.  General Administrative (GA) person that also acts as a secretary, handling the ordering and selling of supplements and assisting the owner in making appointments.

#The Proposed new System
The purpose of this section is to provide the specifications for a new proposed system that will replace the current system. The current data is provided and the new system has to use the current data as a point of entry.

#The new proposed system will consist of the following components:

#Operating System
The current operating system is Windows 10

#Database
There is currently no database installed. The owner does not have MS Access as part of the MS Office package. The proposed database has to be a relational database. The specific database is not precriptive; however it has to be open source and not require license fees. If it is a database that is operating system independent, so much the better, But a Windows based database would sufficent. Since the database has to be accessed via the Web browser and the *Mobile application,* the database has to be hosted in the cloud, but made available offline aswell.

I have decided to make use of MySQL for Azure database that will be hostes in the cloud.
